Usage
Uploading Files
Drag and Drop: You can drag and drop your files or folders directly onto the designated drop zone on the web page.

File Input: Alternatively, click the "Choose Files" button to select files or directories from your local system.

Navigating Directories and Files
Folders: Click on any folder to navigate into it. The contents of the folder will be displayed, and the breadcrumb navigation will update accordingly.

Files: Click on any file to view its content. The file's content will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

Breadcrumb Navigation: Use the breadcrumb trail at the top to navigate back to parent directories. Each segment of the breadcrumb is clickable and will bring you back to that level in the directory structure.

Viewing File Content
When you click on a file, its content will be displayed in the content area on the right side of the screen, allowing you to read or inspect the file content directly within the browser.
